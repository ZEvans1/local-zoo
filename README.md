# _Local Zoo_

#### _A page for keeping track of animals at a zoo for JavaScript week 3 @ Epicodus, Feb. 23, 2018_

#### By _**Zach Evans**_

## Description

_This is an HTML page that uses JavaScript and Angular to keep track of animals at a zoo._

## Future Work

* _Add a map that displays where the animal is located in the zoo._
* _Add a birthday feature (with the addition of a database). On an animal's birthday it will get a special style applied to it. Perhaps there could be a 1-2 week warning so the caretakers could prepare an event for it at the zoo if the animal was popular._
